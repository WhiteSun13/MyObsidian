# Surah Al-Jumu'ah

> [!info]+ About Surah Al-Jumu'ah
> It is derived from the sentence idha nudiya-lis-salat-imin-yaum-il- Jumu'ati of verse 9. Although in this Surah injunctions about the Friday congregational Prayer also have been given, yet 'Jumu'ah' is not the title of its subject-matter as a whole, but this name too, like the names of other Surahs, is only a symbolic title.
