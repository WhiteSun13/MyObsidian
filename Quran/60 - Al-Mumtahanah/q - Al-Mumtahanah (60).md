# Surah Al-Mumtahanah

> [!info]+ About Surah Al-Mumtahanah
> In verse 10 of this Surah it has been enjoined that the women who emigrate to dar al-Islam (the Islamic State) and claim to be Muslims, should be examined hence the title Al-Mumtahinah. The word is pronounced both as mumtahinah and as mumtahanah, the meaning according to the first pronunciation being 'the Surah which examines', and according to the second, 'the woman who is examined.'
