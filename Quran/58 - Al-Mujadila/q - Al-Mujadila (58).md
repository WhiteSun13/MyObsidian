# Surah Al-Mujadila

> [!info]+ About Surah Al-Mujadila
> This Surah is entitled Al Mujadalah as well as Al Mujadilah, the title being derived from the word tujadiluka of the very first verse. As at the outset mention has been made of the woman who pleaded with the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) the case of zihar pronounced by her husband and urged him to suggest a way out of the difficult situation in order to save her and, her children's life from ruin, and Allah has described her pleading by the word 'mujadalah', the Surah came to be known by this very title. If it is read as 'mujadalah', it would mean 'pleading and arguing', and if it is read as 'mujadilah', it would mean 'the woman who pleaded and argued.'
