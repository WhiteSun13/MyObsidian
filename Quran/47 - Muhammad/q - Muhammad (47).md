# Surah Muhammad

> [!info]+ About Surah Muhammad
> The Surah derives its name from the sentence wa amanu bi-ma nuzzila ala Muhammad-in of verse 2, thereby implying that it is the Surah in which the holy name of Muhammad (upon wham be Allah's peace and blessings) has occurred. Besides, it has another well known name 'al-Qital' also, which is derived from the sentence wa dhukira fi-hal-qital of verse 20.
